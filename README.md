# Platform Terminal User Interface

The Platform Terminal User Interface (TUI) is a command line tool designed for creating contracts, registering identities, and performing dynamic actions such as contract updates and identity transactions on the [Dash Platform](https://github.com/dashpay/platform). This versatile tool enables the structured declaration and management of testing strategies, facilitating their execution on the blockchain network. TUI handles all blockchain-related activities on the Dash Platform according to the specified testing strategy. Its primary purpose is to test the platform's robustness and stability. Whether it's a simple transfer operation or managing a complex contract lifecycle, TUI can automatically submit various state transitions to the Dash Platform at a specified rate and for a selected duration or number of blocks.​​​​​​​  

Currently on Testnet only.
